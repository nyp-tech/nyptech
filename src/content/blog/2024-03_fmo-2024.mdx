# Discovering Talent

Our aim is to identify individuals who are not only deeply committed but also equipped to advance the frontier of innovation. The Recruitment and Freshman Orientation Program has proven to be a successful platform for this purpose.

## Subcomm Recruitment

Led by Wei Heng, Rohan, and Jeren, the recruitment took place on Discord. Our subcommittee members discussed the values they hoped to both contribute to and gain from the club. After a mutual agreement on these values, we selected a group of promising individuals who align well with our objectives.

## Freshman Orientation (FMO)

The orientation served as a perfect opportunity to raise awareness about our club, encourage sign-ups, and engage new students with a mini-challenge centered around entrepreneurial thinking. This initiative was enthusiastically received by the freshmen, igniting their interest in the opportunities our school has to offer.

## Reflecting on Our Success

Reflecting on our first two events, we feel confident in their success and believe we have fulfilled our initial goals. The enthusiasm and engagement from participants confirm we are on the right track.

This journey has just begun, and we are excited to see where these new talents will take us in the realm of innovation.
