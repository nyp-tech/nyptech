# Why?

Have you ever tried to find a URL shortener service that is **easy-to-use**, **clean and sleak**, and most importantly, **FREE**.

Well, in most cases, nope.

You see, popular services such as [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com) and [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) offers such services. But it's *ridiculous* to pay $9.99 per month just to change the destination link or even delete a link. Heck, purchasing a YouTube Premium subscription is much more worth than this.

It is really ridiculous.

So, our team came up with the solution to building up our very own URL shortener service from scratch.

# Development

For our solution, we'll use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as per our tech stack. And [daisyui](https://daisyui.com) as our user interface design library.

# Security

Before we began using Clerk as our authentication service, we wrote our own auth system.

Our auth system utilities basic cookies and middleware.

# Conclusion

Lesson learnt. Build your own. Don't use others, or pay them.
