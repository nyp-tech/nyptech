# Combining "Technology" with "Entrepreneurship"

`Mission` Our aim is to foster an entrepreneurial mindset among SIT students by engaging them in real-world problem-solving and technology application.

## Inception

`Cutting Edge`
At the Technopreneurship Club, we're dedicated to redefining how SIT students perceive and engage with entrepreneurship. We aim to inspire meaningful change within our community. We believe the current school environment doesn't fully support rapid and iterative learning paradigms essential for creating a better, faster, and safer experience for all. If there's a tool needed for success, we're here to teach you how to wield it.

## Mission

`Technopreneurship` combines the essence of "technology" and "entrepreneurship." It revolves around entrepreneurial activities that create and leverage technology-driven opportunities. This approach not only focuses on innovation within digital and tech sectors but also on cultivating new and existing technologies to establish businesses, develop new products, and introduce innovative services. Our goal is to help you add significant value to your community.

## Goals

- We believe that understanding and leveraging failure is key to success. Our goal is to teach you how to effectively manage and learn from failures to foster personal and professional growth.
- Interdisciplinary approaches are fundamental to entrepreneurship. Technopreneurship is not merely about technological innovation but also about transforming these innovations into competitive businesses. We aim to provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary educational experience to all club members.
- We encourage you to embrace trials. Entrepreneurship can be demanding—emotionally, physically, and financially. We're committed to nurturing your inner innovator and creator.

## Values

Understand and appreciate your worth, recognize your limits, and learn how to enhance the strengths you possess. Define your value and present it effectively to those around you.

Trust in our vision and join us—you won’t be disappointed!
