🙋‍♂️I'm Wei Heng, a Year 3 student in Applied AI & Analytics. Thanks to Ms Teo's introduction, I joined the Technopreneurship Club! The IEO Jumpstart Grant success ignited my passion for the Technopreneurship space, and I became committed to encouraging more SIT students to start their ventures.💡📝As the club's secretary, I take on administrative responsibilities such as information dissemination, documentation management, minutes, and attendance tracking. Additionally, I contribute to event organisation, offer suggestions, and develop our dev team.💻When I'm not engaged with the club, I enjoy card games, playing the piano, running, and keeping myself in shape.💪
