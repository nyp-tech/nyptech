Hi, I'm Rohan, a third-year Cybersecurity and digital Forensics student. I am glad to have the opportunity to lead this club with like-minded individuals to not only develop myself as an individual but also foster a greater entrepreneurial spirit and mindset within NYP. My hope is to better prepare students to pursue their ideas and tackle any challenges they face with a resilient mind and efficient problem-solving skills. Outside the usual technological domain, I enjoy playing sports, especially football.
