Hey hey! Iâ€™m Iqbal, someone whoâ€™s always curious, ambitious, and up for a challenge ðŸ˜†ðŸš€. I love meeting new people, learning cool things, and figuring out how stuff works: whether itâ€™s in tech, entrepreneurship, or just life in general.
Youâ€™ll probably find me brainstorming wild ideas, leading the Technopreneurship Club, or diving into random deep convos ðŸ¤“ðŸ’¡. I enjoy a good mix of fun and productivity, whether itâ€™s exploring new concepts, cracking jokes, or just vibing with great company.
Lifeâ€™s too short to stay in the comfort zone, so Iâ€™m here to learn, grow, and make the most of every experience âœ¨. Letâ€™s see where this journeyÂ takesÂ me!Â ðŸš€
