Hello, Im Keshu, easily recognised and notoriously known by students in NYP 😋 for various reasons. In a sea full of navy men, why not be a pirate 🏴‍☠️ ? Reviving quirkiness whilst trying to make a dent in the world  😆. Technopreneurship Club is present to define Entrepreneurship and innovation here in NYP. Sky is the limit for many but not for the ones who believe in our club’s values. Interested? My LinkedIn is open to anyone 😊 as well as the club’s email.
