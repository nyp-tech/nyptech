Hey guys! Joshua here, third-year Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Student and currently the head of Publicity in the club. I mainly joined this club to meet other like-minded individuals who share the same interest in entrepreneurship. Outside the club, I occasionally stream and create content, I also have my own startup clothing brand and I really love boxing. I too have a strong passion for entrepreneurship and social media in general, and would love to give each and everyone of you the opportunity to shine and innovate.
