So the semester ends with a celebration, and the last presentation test was finally over. I have presented the app development project for an outstanding project presentation. I edited some videos, put the project in my portfolio and did some speed optimizations. My group was ready to go on our merry way to start our semester break. A few of us went to work part-time or started getting ready for the next study year.

During the semester break, I went for a cca passing down session of which I was announced as the next head of programs EXCO for the upcoming year and have started planning new programs and events for the cca. I was also working part-time and was relatively busy during the period. Mid-way through one of the cca training sessions for excos, I received a text message from my class teacher, calling me to get myself prepared for a meeting with the course coordinator, module leader and himself. I was concerned. Online... Typing... Online... was what kept me awake in the hot afternoon sun.

"could you excuse yourself tmr in the morning? this is an important issue as a complaint has been made out against you"

I was taken aback, that sounded serious and I did not want to take any chances, I proceeded to ask, " What is the complaint that was made?" Soon followed by a "Plagiarism" I did not expect that. I went to forward the message to my project group. Everyone went into panic mode. We made a potential list of suspects that could had made a complaint against us and where are the potential areas that we have taken our code from. After half an hour of discussion, we found that it could have been from a code I had copied from github. It was a function to turn api calls and requests into a QR code that on scan, allows the user to make registration into the database.

To me, I was the one that jeopardized the whole group into a complaint issue that could cause us our grades, our reputation and needing to redo that module again. I felt guilty and really bad that I could potentially cause so much implication to my group and affect them in such drastic ways. My group members helped made a case for me to lessen my "sentence"

The next morning came and I decided to come prepared with my argument points and reasoning for my actions. I felt like a lawyer that was ready to enter a courtroom. I went there early to scout out the meeting location, I waited for a while before the teachers came. Each one of them came with a laptop and stack of papers, almost like they are ready to reject every one of my claims. I started to internalize my points and tried to remember every single coding and devops concept I know.

"We advice that you say nothing but the truth, if we find any inconsistencies, this will escalate the issue into a bigger one'. The course coordinator stated. She conducted a quick interrogation session to fact-check what has happen. Shen then handed me a paper to write down what I just said to be sent for higher management to view. She stated that the school has some algorithms to see the matching percentage of the project and many other state-of-the-art advanced tools to see if I am telling the truth. I felt really intimidated. My class teacher was just typing away of everything that was said.After the interrogation session, she mentioned that she will be seeing my teammates to find out the story from their perspective.

Two weeks rolled by, and soon I asked my friend if the case was over. Just when I click send, a notification popped out. "Hi Sven, can we get you and your group to come in tomorrow at 9am?". Oh no, welp at least we can get it over and done with. My team and the teachers met facing one another in like a circle format. They talked about testing it with their team and realizing that there is a significant modification to the code to the point where it can be considered original. The case was considered as closed and I was happ the case was just a close call.

## My conclusions

There was many errors done on my part, I had done many errors in the whole process of developing this app development project. I will continuously improve my self and try to make less mistakes.

## End Notes
I have apologized to the relevant parties and the issue had ended on good terms.
